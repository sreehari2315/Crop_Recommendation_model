# Crop_Recommendation_model - SAV169
The Crop Recommendation System aims to leverage data-driven techniques to assist farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection based on location-specific parameters such as soil characteristics, seasonal weather conditions, and climatic factors.

## Problem Statement:
The global economy depends heavily on agriculture, and meeting the rising demand for food requires increasing agricultural output. Because environmental and climatic circumstances differ, farmers frequently struggle to choose the best crops for their area.By providing customised recommendations, the model helps to overcome this problem as it considers the connections between different environmental parameters and crop performance. This system may also recommend an appropriate crop to be yielded in a region based on the provided inputs, making it a flexible solution.

## Tech Stack for Crop Recommendation System:
The IBM Z tool we have used here is the LinuxOne community Cloud's Jupyter Lab.To develop a Crop Recommendation System, a comprehensive tech stack is required to handle various tasks such as data collection, preprocessing, machine learning.

## Proposed Solution:
This system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze a wide range of input attributes, including  rainfall, pH levels, soilcolor,precipation sum and the presence of essential soil nutrients like potassium (K), phosphorus (P), and nitrogen (N) which are vital for determining crop suitability and maximizing yield. By processing these features, the system predicts the optimal crop type that can thrive in the given environmental conditions, thereby reducing the guesswork for farmers and improving yields.

The process begins with data collection, where information about soil properties and climate is gathered. The data undergoes encoding to convert any categorical variables (if present) into numerical form, followed by preprocessing, which includes handling missing values, normalising data, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

Next, we apply machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Means Clustering, Logistic Regression and Decision Trees. These models are trained on historical crop and soil data to learn the relationships between soil attributes and crop performance. The SVM is used for classification by identifying optimal boundaries between crop types, while the Decision Tree captures complex interactions between input variables to predict the most appropriate crop.

After training, the system can predict the ideal crop for a given set of conditions, providing farmers with tailored recommendations. This data-driven approach not only optimizes crop selection but also contributes to sustainable farming by enhancing productivity and reducing risks.

## Conclusion:
The Crop Recommendation System not only optimizes crop selection but also helps in sustainable farming practices by minimizing resource wastage, improving soil management, and enhancing productivity. The long-term goal of the system is to empower farmers with actionable insights that lead to improved decision-making, higher crop yields, and better resilience to environmental fluctuations.
